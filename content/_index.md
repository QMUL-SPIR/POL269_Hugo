Welcome to POL269 - Political Data Research. My name is [Dr. Javier Sajuria](www.sajuria.com) and I am the convenor for this module. This module is co-taught with [Dr. Sofia Collingon](https://sofiacollignon.com).



## Module overview {-} 

This module provides essential research training in the use of **quantitative methods in the political and social sciences**. We introduce you to how we use quantitative data to learn about the political world, by teaching you the **theory behind quantitative data analysis** and giving you **hands-on experience in using the statistical software `R`**.
The course is, therefore, particularly useful for those interested in a future career in data analytics or in 
becoming critical consumers of quantitative research. The module caters to students from diverse 
academic disciplines and adopts a practical approach to learning, with weekly computer tutorials.   


The module covers **descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data access, probability, sampling, hypothesis testing, inferential statistics and linear regression**. 
Students will be introduced to the `R` statistical software and work with data used in current academic research.


## Advice and Feedback Hours {-}

**Please make use of our advice and feedback hours!**

My advice and feedback hours are **Tuesdays 10.00-11.00** and by appointment. You can book your slot [via Calendly](https://calendly.com/drjaviersajuria/afhour?).
